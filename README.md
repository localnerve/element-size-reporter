# React Size Reporter
> A higher order React component that reports rendered size and top for one or more components.

Use to wrap a React component to report its size (and top) in a flux flow. Can use in concert with other components to calculate a region composed of multiple components. This is especially useful for background images that span multiple components.

Size is reported first in componentDidMount, then updated on window resize events.

## WIP
This is a work in progress. More detailed docs to come.
